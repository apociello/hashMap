# hashMap
This project implements a HashMap from scratch in JavaScript using LinkedLists to handle collisions.

It supports basic operations such as inserting, retrieving, checking, and removing key-value pairs. The map automatically grows when the load factor is exceeded.

The goal of this project is to understand how hash maps work internally, including hashing, collision handling, and dynamic resizing.
